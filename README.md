## Why Parkify?

The application will make it easier for the drivers to find and pre-book their slots at the parking locations. The application will also save the frustration of the drivers who at times out of urgency park their cars on the street itself, which further adds to the traffic in the locality. With the use of the application, business professionals can focus on their daily tasks and not worry about their parking space.


## Built With

This application is built on nodeJS, typed in javascript. Vanilla html-css-js is used to built the frontend.

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, npm, installed in your environement.

### Node

-   #### Node installation on Windows

    Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
    Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

-   #### Node installation on Ubuntu

    You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

        $ sudo apt install nodejs
        $ sudo apt install npm

-   #### Other Operating Systems
    You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g
